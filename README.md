# Downloader to bypass server side speed limiting
This script can easily speedup your download upto 900 times if server limits your download speed greatly and you have fast internet connection.


When it asks how many times to speed up the download, enter a reasonable number keeping your system's RAM and processor in mind. For example, 800 is good for computer with 4GB of RAM and Intel i3 processor.

This program splits up the file to be downloaded into many parts (which is decided by how many times you want to speed up the download) and then it fetched all those parts parallely from the remote server.

This program was just made for fun. At the time of publishing it to github, it did not had all the exception handling as required. Feel free to work on it.
